# Lindyhop-Moves

This project contains a simple html and css prototype of a website where users can save their dancing or lindy hop moves. This page illustrates one move with a video and a description what to do in a table.

Future functionalities:
- User login and registration
- The user is able to save lists of their lindy hop moves from a pool of moves.
- The user is able to comment on one lindy hop move (in order to improve it or to discuss alternatives/variations).
- The owner of a lindy hop move is able to edit one lindy hop move by clicking into the table.
- Lindy hop moves are sorted by categories (e.g. 6-count moves, 8-count moves, swingout variations etc)
